    								Unemployment or joblessness is the situation of actively looking for employment but not being currently employed. The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force. According to International Labour Organization report, more than 200 million people globally or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.

    							<br>
    							<br>
    							Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption), to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime.

    							<STRONG><p class="title is-3 has-text-centered">SOLUTION</p></STRONG>
    							<br>
    							Corruption is using a persons power or influence to bribe money from the people that results to crisis to our country because they are using their power and influence as their advantage. Mostly corruption refers to a politician or maybe on a company. But how could we solve this? They should monitor companies and goverment electronically ofcourse it needs to be done or installed secretly, without the companies or government awareness so that it is impossible for them to tampered it.

    							<br>
    							Another solution is for each country to have an initiatives for anti-corruption together with a international body that can help them monitor tue corruption on a specific counrtry. And also the most important solution for corruption is that you should not follow that dirty act. Because change will start if one has been attained because the people will surely follow it.

    							The unemployment rate in the Philippines dropped to 5.4 percent in the September quarter of 2018 from 5.6 percent a year ago. The number of unemployed persons went down by 50 thousand to 2.32 million while the number of employed increased by 488 thousand to 40.66 million. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate declined to 60.1 percent from 60.6 percent. Among employed persons, workers in the services sector made up 57.5 percent of the total, followed by those in the agriculture sector (23.1 percent) and industry (19.4 percent). Unemployment Rate in Philippines averaged 8.41 percent from 1994 until 2018, reaching an all time high of 13.90 percent in the first quarter of 2000 and a record low of 4.70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.

    							<STRONG><p class="title is-3 has-text-centered">SOLUTION</p></STRONG>
    							<br>
    							Solution that I personally can suggest to our rising rate of unemployment is job oppurtunities. Indeed, Filipinos are skillful when it comes to white collar jobs. We can easily learn something and is eagered to learn specially when we are in need of job. We also had a trait where we are not ppicky on what job and in what position a company will let us play for as long as it could help us ear money to provide our family their needs.

    							<br>
    							However, there are companies who requires individuals to be literate and be at least a graduate of high school to be validated as a worth worker to hire for; and not all of us can do that, immediately, because of being lack in financial needs. So for a better opnion, we have to be more gumptious and hard working so that even we, ourselves can not make it to a blue collar job, at least we can send our future generation to an oppurtunity to be capable on that kind of job. Also, we could perceive a better future not only for us but, for the society as well.

    							The transportation infrastructure that supports our daily lives has been continuously evolving. At the same time, the concentration of growing populations in urban areas stemming from economic development is leading to serious traffic congestion and environmental degradation. As a means for resolving these issues, large cities are extending subway lines and expanding other public transportation systems. The increased economic burden involved in the construction and operation of these systems, however, has heightened the need for a transportation infrastructure that can be built and operated at lower costs.

    							Many of us, specially the millenials who donâ€™t get used to understand why price ceiling on the market is getting high as the oil hike arises too. What we donâ€™t know is, most of our goods were imported from another country as we canâ€™t provide such ingredients we use to formulate a one nutrious and good meal. As well as we do, goods that we can proved (such as rice grainaries) is being exported to the
    							internatinal market. What we use for exporting and importing goods is transportation, many forms of engine were used for it to be done engine use different type of oil to make it work.

    							<br>
    							Being a student, what we could suggest about the addition of the transportation to the rising rate of poverty is to understand more about the connection of the oil price hike and the market ceiling price increase. Seeing transportation as a major cause of poverty is somewhat absurd to look up on but, indeed it is a major factor. What we could do is to work hard and to mock less about the market price increase because it wouldnâ€™t help us anyways, what would help us more is ourselves to work harder to maintain a good status in life. It is true that somehow, government has the responsibility on this kind of factor; one reasons is because of the living crocodiles who happen to work at government agencies that steal people's money however, we cannot guarantee that they are just the reason of this leveling crisis in transportation. And we can not blame some agencies who implements such increments because, they are just following order.

    							At the basic education level, the Department of Education (DepEd) sets overall educational standards and mandates standardized tests for the Kâ€“12 basic education system, although private schools are generally free to determine their own curriculum in accordance with existing laws and Department regulations. On the other hand, at the higher education level, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) supervises and regulates colleges and universities, while the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for technical and vocational institutions regulates and accredits technical and vocational education programs and institutions. For the academic year 2017â€“2018, about 83% of Kâ€“12 students attended public schools and about 17% either attended private schools or were home-schooled. By law, education is compulsory for thirteen years (kindergarten and grades 1â€“12). These are grouped into three levels: elementary school (kindergartenâ€“grade 6), junior high school (grades 7â€“10), and senior high school (grades 11â€“12); they may also be grouped into four key stages: 1st key stage (kindergartenâ€“grade 3), 2nd key stage (grades 4â€“6), 3rd key stage (grades 7â€“10) and 4th key stage (grades 11â€“12). Children enter kindergarten at age 5. Institutions of higher education may be classified as either public or private college or university, and public institutions of higher education may further be subdivided into two types: state universities and colleges and local colleges and universities.

    							Education is a very important key in fighting poverty. It is one of the wealth you can share but cannot be taken by anyone. In the Philippines, the children are very lucky because their elementary, high school and eventually college education are being provided free of charge. And most people can attain this privilege, for the public schools that provide free education are scattered everywhere throughout the archipelago. But problems arise along with the emergence of new school buildings and new schools. Lack of books, seats, rooms, and teachers are some of the problems many schools are facing every year. Schools try to alleviate the situation by coming up with short and long-term solutions. Like implementing morning and afternoon shifts, or erecting new buildings for new and existing students to use. Students sometimes adapt by sharing books or other educational references for two or more people.

Dentistry, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, audiology, pharmacy, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health professions are all part of healthcare. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.

    							4 Possible solution for better healthcare in the Philippines.
    							<br>
    							<br>
    							Healthcare is one of the extreme effects of poverty in the philippines. Filipinos are having to survive their health by limited medicine and poor filipino can't reduce poverty without a strong public healthcare system.
    							<br>
    							<br>
    							1. The first problem here in the Philippines about healthcare is lack of facilities and few hospitals. Medical staffs are expertly trained but the facilities are inadequate. They should improve health facilities to treat our people and increase the budget for the facilities.
    							<br><br>
    							2. Employ and train more medical workers. They should provide the needs like health facilities of medical staff to enhance their expertise in medicine.
    							<br><br>
    							3. Improve PhilHealth benefits. Enroll all poor Filipinos and inform about the awareness on how to use the card. 
    							<br><br>
    							4. Lower the cost of medicines. Promote generic medicines to reduce the fees and for the Filipinos to afford the cost of their need medicine.
